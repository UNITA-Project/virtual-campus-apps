NAME
	SOMA - PmWiki 2 skin

DESCRIPTION

	A colorful, simple and functional skin, using tables and css . hopefully the skin is
	xhtml 1.0 and css2 valid, if not, I'll keep updating till it is .

	It looks quite same in Internet Explorer and Firefox.

	If you are going to use in a UNIX enviroment, be sure to pay attention to permissions
	and ownership the files inside the zip file have no of those set.

	Use the the soma.php file to include a subtitle using the variable $WikiSubTitle,
	change the Title with $WikiTitle and copyright message with $WikiRightsMsg .


INSTALLATION

	To add the theme to your PmWiki2 installation, follow these
	basic steps:
	    
	1. Download the theme archive and extract the files it contains.
	    
	2. Upload the directory 'soma' to the pub/skins directory provided by PmWiki on your
	   server.
	    
	3. Add the following to your local configuration file (config.php).

	    $Skin = 'soma';

	4. Look at ownership and permission of files if you have any trouble.
