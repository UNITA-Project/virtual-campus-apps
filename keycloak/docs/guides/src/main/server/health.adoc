summary="Learn how to enable and use Keycloak health checks"
includedOptions="health-enabled">

Keycloak has built in support for health checks. This guide describes how to enable and use the Keycloak health checks.

== Keycloak Health checks

Keycloak exposed health endpoints are three:

* `/health`
* `/health/live`
* `/health/ready`

The result is returned in json format and it looks as follows:
[source, json]
----
{
    "status": "UP",
    "checks": [
        {
            "name": "Keycloak database connections health check",
            "status": "UP"
        }
    ]
}
----

== Enabling the health checks
Is possible to enable the health checks using the build time option `health-enabled`:
<@kc.build parameters="--health-enabled=true"/>
